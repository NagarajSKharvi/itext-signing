# The PKCS#11 device used

For the tests [SoftHSM2](https://www.opendnssec.org/softhsm/) is used as device addressed via PKCS#11.

Installation and configuration details are explained in the `README.md` of the parallel project `mkl.itext.signing:itext-signing-pkcs11` which also focuses on signing with iText 7 via PKCS#11 but runs in a newer JRE.
